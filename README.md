# Cat_Planner
Does your cat make too much fuss? Is it too disorganised? Here's a cat planner for your cat to help your cat be more catty

## How to use
Cat planner is pretty straightforward in its current form. All you need to do is clone the repo, ensure you've got ruby installed, and then run it in your command line.

### Future human plans
Cat planner would be great as a Twitterbot. As soon as I teach myself how to do that, it will be done. Then you can all tune in to what my cat is currently doing at any moment of the day!
